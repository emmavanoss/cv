# Emma Van Oss

## Who I am

I'm a full-stack junior web developer with a background in linguistics (undergrad), psychology (MSc) and professional experience with social research, statistics, project management and the public sector.

I've been coding since January 2019 and I've never looked back. Being able to
dream something up and then create it is an incredible feeling, and there is so
much to learn and explore that I don't think I'll ever want to stop. The
technologies and patterns and ideas I've learned during my 12 weeks at Makers
feels like the very tip of the iceberg, so I've been using my free time to jump
off from that into different ideas, for example exploring functional
programming in Elixir. Now I'm looking for a job as a developer where I can learn fast,
with exciting new challenges and ideas.

My favourite projects so far have been:

* [Snappy pictures](https://snappy.pictures/) - this is a game I'm working on which is currently deployed with Netlify at [snappy.pictures](https://snappy.pictures/) (tap/click to move a square and refresh for a new board), with the backend deployed separately on Heroku. I originally made a frontend-only version before I started Makers to try out React and I'm now building a backend to handle shuffling, completion and highscores, and to enable players to battle 1-on-1 using the same seeded shuffled board. The [frontend code](https://github.com/emmavanoss/snappy-frontend) is bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the [backend](https://github.com/emmavanoss/snappy-backend) is with node.

* [CashCow](https://cashcow2020.herokuapp.com/) - my final project at Makers. I spent two weeks putting together this stock market tracking webapp in a team of four. The code for both front and backend is [here](https://github.com/CodeKrakken/cashcow). The app hits a number of external APIs (including [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and [Google news](https://newsapi.org/s/google-news-api)) to gather up-to-date financial and news data for any stock symbol (e.g. TSLA or MSFT) and displays this in a single-page React app, using D3.js to create a seven-day chart and making a buy/sell/stick recommendation based on a calculated 50-day moving average. Users can also create an account to track stocks in their own portfolio.
    
* [Binstagram](https://github.com/emmavanoss/binstagram) - a Rails app
  emulating the famous photo sharing platform (but with bins). This was a 'weekend challenge' I completed during the Makers course. 
  I had fun
  working out how to create user accounts and authentication, etc., with
  minimal baggage given the small size of the app. It was good practice as well
  working out how to store pictures in ActiveRecord, and implementing some
  basic security and display concerns with Rails.

These projects hopefully help demonstrate my excitement about programming. I
would love to find a job that will help me continue to learn as much as
possible, and help me develop my processes and best practice to keep writing
better and better code.

## Tech skills

* Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec and Sinatra
* JavaScript (including ES6), React, D3, JQuery, Node, Jasmine and Sinon
* SQLite, Postgres, ActiveRecord and DataMapper and tablePlus
* HTML, css, Python and Elixir

## Other skills

* **Solid processes** - Through Makers I've developed a methodical TDD process that helps me tackle any new problem calmly and methodically. I invest time in planning and follow a strict red-green-refactor process, always looking for the smallest, simplest and most useful next step. This has allowed me to build my own projects outside the course, like [snappy pictures](https://snappy.pictures/), using previously unfamiliar frameworks/technologies like React.

*  **Focus on human readability** - I agree with the philosophy that code should speak to humans first and machines second. Programming involves constant updates and changes, whether to your own code or someone else's, and a clean, clear codebase that can easily be changed is my ideal. I always try to write good-quality code, aligned with the SOLID principles, that expresses itself clearly and is easy to read and change.

* **People skills** - In my opinion, working well with others is one of the most important skills in any job. You can't expect to make useful, creative and intelligent software without communicating with your teammates and clients. What is more, learning from other people is the fastest way to build your own understanding, and expose yourself to new ideas. I've demonstrated and developed these skills during my previous life as a social researcher and consultant, and continue to apply them in group projects at Makers, developing apps like [CashCow](https://github.com/CodeKrakken/cashcow) and [Acebook-Greenbook](https://github.com/elfiyang16/acebook-greenbook) in teams over two-week sprints.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (September 2019 - January 2020)

Intensive bootcamp for web development (one month of remote study and three months on-site)
- OOP, TDD, MVC
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Westminster (2015-2016)

*Psychology Msc (Distinction)*

* One-year conversion course equivalent to three-year degree + master's  
* Lots of group projects producing coursework and research projects  
* Awarded Distinction for my dissertation, where I used field research and specialist statistical analysis 
  software to model the impact of community gardening projects on mental wellbeing

#### Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, France (2014-2015)

*Exchange program*

* Spent a year on exchange at a prestigious French postgrad university
* No course credit requirements and I wasn't being graded, so I tried lots of things, like comparative literature and advanced French
* Visited new places, met new people and rediscovered the fun of learning things for their own sake, without worrying about exams

#### Trinity College, Cambridge (2011-2014)

*Linguistics BA (1st Class Honours)*

* Three-year degree in the science of language, including syntax, semantics,
  phonology & phonetics, sociolinguistics, history and language change, and 
  first and second language acquisition
* Specialised in historical linguistics and language change
* Awarded Distinction for my dissertation, where I tested whether historical reconstruction techniques could be applied to sign languages. I used the Comparative Method (developed for spoken languages) to model three sign languages that are known to have some shared history (BSL, Auslan and NZSL), and one that's known to be unrelated (ASL). I reconstructed a family tree using the established techniques, and tested whether the results matched up to the known historical relationships of these four languages - spoiler, they did not
* Won a Tripos Prize for outstanding results in 2014 and 2012, and a Junior Scholarship in 2012
* Played very badly for the women's football team in 2012-2014, and loved it
